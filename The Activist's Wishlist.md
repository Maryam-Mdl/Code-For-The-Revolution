# The Activist's Wishlist
This is a list of tools and resources that people living under authoritarian regimes **urgently need**. The goal is to inspire coders worldwide to develop and share open-source solutions that can make a real difference.
If you have coding skills and are looking for a meaningful project, **check out the ideas below!**

## Live Map
**For many people, having a real-time overview of events in their city can be crucial.** A great example is [HKmap.live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKmap.live), an app developped and used during the 2019 Hong Kong protests. It provided crowdsourced, real-time geolocation data, enabling citizens to track police movements, protester locations, tear gas deployments, and more.

## Tools for a decentralized leadership
[Decentralized leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised) through social media has proven transformative for civil movements. Decentralized leadership gives protesters **greater fluidity** and makes it **harder for authorities to identify representatives for prosecution**.

Hong Kong’s 2019 democracy movement unfolded in a largely decentralized way, and in Nepal in 2025, Gen Z protesters coordinated[ through TikTok and Discord](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/young-activists-who-toppled-nepals-government-now-picking-new-leaders-2025-09-14/), and managed to protest successfully into new elections, leading to the [**first ever state leader elected through Discord**](https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/south-asia/nepal-sushila-karki-new-prime-minister-discord-protests-b2826473.html).

**Yet, decentralized leadership also has its limitations**. As civil rights scholar Clayborne Carson observed about the Black Lives Matter protests: 

_“There is no established leadership to articulate messages. What is the goal? Is it simply to express anger or is it to achieve reform? If it is to bring about reform, then what would that look like? It doesn’t have to be one charismatic spokesperson. It could be many leaders, but there needs to be people saying, ‘This is what we want’ and clearly articulating that. That’s just not happening now with any consistency.”_

This underscores **the need for better organization within decentralized movements**. These questions must be addressed and tools need to be developped that allow to leverage the strengths of decentralized leadership while mitigating its weaknesses.
