Welcome to the **Code For The Revolution** initiative ! We're a collective of developers and engineers working on building free, open-source and widely available tools to facilitate civil movements against authoritarian regimes.

If you know anything about technology and are looking for your next project, check out **[The Activist's Wishlist](https://github.com/Maryam-Mdl/Code-For-The-Revolution/blob/main/The%20Activist's%20Wishlist.md#the-activists-wishlist)** for inspiration. You might develop a tool that will help topple oppressive regimes.

Interested in joining the **Code for the Revolution** initiative ? please reach out to maryam.mdl@proton.me (Anonymousity not required, but encouraged)

**Are you a journalist, activist, or protester living under an authoritarian regime?**
Can you think of any tool or resource you need, but doesnâ€™t yet exist? please reach out to maryam.mdl@proton.me. Your input could help developers worldwide build solutions that make a real difference.
